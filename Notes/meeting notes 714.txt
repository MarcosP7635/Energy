schedule deans tutors during summer and fall? 
unclear what the options are so 
	iff bethany attended the meeting, would that be helpful? 

stick to one lab!! I pick up too many things. bethany said consider the Mawet Group. 
	for bethany, it would be a project from scratch. 
	one good project is the way to go. 
	reach out to the mawet group and ask what it would like

ask the group in japan and talk to them about the project and ask about the group. what should I read? 

depending on the conversation with the mawet group, explore a new area!
maybe find a nuclear group? reach out to kellogg and ucla and fillipone and huztler
