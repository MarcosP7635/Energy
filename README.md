# Documentation
This project mostly consists of Jupyter notebooks that contain Julia and/or Python code to simulate energy storage. Specifically, storing energy by producing radionuclides. 
The majority of the original code is in the folder named JupyterNotebooks. Each Jupyter notebook is stored as a .ipynb file and has its own internal documentation.
