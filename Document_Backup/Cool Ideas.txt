Things to Investigate
Shielding 
Current plan for shielding: 1mm of water sandwiched by 1micron plates of lead on each side.

The easiest way to do this is retractable and expandable shielding

                                Script in (a) Colaboratory cell(s) that quantifies the merits of each
isotope (in no particular order yet): availability, cost, time to produce and acquire, and proximity of half-life to a century. 
Ideally this would be a very general set of functions and/or classes to evaluate isotopes and an automated (or just fast/low effort) way to acquire relevant data.  


First, determine which decay paths are most promising (the ones that need the least shielding?)

Potential Applications
A smartphone needs on the order of 20 W, so assuming we need the isotope to produce on the order of 10^1.9 W/mg = 80W/mg the graph implies this could be powered continuously for 30 years! Could this be used for supercomputers too? 
Only 1g needed to produce a kW for a century. Surely a hospital would benefit from this? 
It doesn’t even need to be fissile!!
There are around 10^4.5 hospitals in the US and they each consume ~5% of the total US energy supply which is has grown by ~1000x since 2007 which was then estimated to be 10^17 J cumulatively in the US. Thus we have 17-1.5 = 16.5. 
Thus a hospital in the US needs 10^16.5 J. This seems wrong. Revise later.
Revising ->
The US uses around 1.3 kW/person
(Handy conversion- 1Btu ~ 10^-3.5 kWH)
Thus, according to https://www.eia.gov/international/rankings/world?pa=12&u=0&f=A&v=none&y=01%2F01%2F2019, the US uses .03 quadrillion Btu = 30 trillion kWH. Assuming hospitals use on the order of ~5% of the US energy supply we jave 1.5 trillion kWH used by US hospitals in 2019. Assuming there are 10^4.5 hospitals we have 2*10^7 kWH consumed by the average US hospital in 2019. 
Thus, each hospital each year needs about 2*10^15 J. This is nearly one order of magnitude off from the sketchy estimate before revising. If 1mg of a 100-y half life isotope can provide 1W for a century, then (by the revises estimate of annual power consumption), on average in 2019 a US hospital needed 2*10^7.5 W. Thus, each hospital would need ~10^8 mg or 100 kg to be powered autonomously without interruption for a century. The entire US's energy needs (at the 2019 rate of consumption) for the next century would only need 10^8 kg.

Cheap radioactive minerals? 
Is there a cheap fast way to purify uranium containing minerals?
Assumptions to account for
Under what criteria is half-life constant? What decay paths will occur? What shielding is sufficient?
