We present an atlas of nuclear isomers containing the experimental data for the isomers with a
half-life ≥ 10 ns together with their various properties such as excitation-energy, half-life, decay
mode(s), spin-parity, energies and multipolarities of emitted gamma transitions, etc. The ENSDF
database complemented by the XUNDL database has been extensively used in extracting the relevant
data. Recent literature from primary nuclear physics journals, and the NSR bibliographic database
have been searched to ensure that the compiled data Table is as complete and current as possible.
The data from NUBASE-12 have also been checked for completeness, but as far as possible original
references have been cited. Many interesting systematic features of nuclear isomers emerge, some of
them new; these are discussed and presented in various graphs and figures. The cutoff date for the
extraction of data from the literature is August 15, 2015.
I. INTRODUCTION
The nuclear isomers are excited metastable states of
nuclei, which experience a hindrance in their decays. Nuclear
isomers have been the focus of attention since early
days, and were first foreseen by Soddy in 1917 [1], when
he remarked, “We can have isotopes with the identity
of atomic weight, as well as of chemical character, which
are different in their stabilities and mode of breaking up.”
Otto Hahn is generally credited with the first experimental
observation of isomers in Uranium salts [2]. But, as
pointed out by Walker and Carroll [3], the first such observations
were in all probability made by Kurtchatov
et al of Soviet Union [4] and, Szilard and Chalmers of
Britain [5] in the Br and In isotopes. An interpretation
of isomers in terms of hindered gamma decay was provided
by Weizsacker in 1936 [6]. A correlation of the
existence of isomers with the shell structure and levels
having considerably different angular momenta was first
discussed by Feenberg [7], Feenberg and Hammack [8]
and Nordheim [9]. Goldhaber and Hill [10] presented the
very first collection of isomers and their detailed discussion
in terms of the shell structure. Feenberg [11] later
on followed this up in his book by presenting the data on
nearly 100 isomers and providing their interpretation in
terms of the single particle shell model.
On the basis of the inhibition mechanism, the isomers
are generally classified into four types: the spin isomers,
the K-isomers, the shape isomers and the fission isomers
[12]. A fifth category of isomers known as the seniority
isomers makes an appearance, mostly in semi-magic

nuclei when the configuration comprises broken pairs of
particles [13]. In the past decade, there has been a rapid
growth in the experimental and theoretical studies of isomers
as they are able to provide a unique window into the
nuclear structure properties in unusual situations, as well
as many known applications. New isomers in different regions
of nuclear landscape, excitation energies and spins
continue to be discovered at a fast pace with the availability
of several radioactive ion-beam facilities and state-ofthe-
art nuclear experimental techniques, and prompted
by possibilities of novel practical applications [14].
It is now possible to measure a broad range of halflives,
extending from picoseconds to years with the advancements
in experimental techniques. As a result, the
lower limit of the half-life used to define isomers has
been decreasing over the years. The very first version
of Nubase in 1997 [15] used the definition of an isomer
as the excited state having a half-life greater than
1 ms; the ENSDF (Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data
File) database [16] also defined an isomer likewise. Later
on, Nubase 2003 [17] lowered the limit to 100 ns. The
Nubase 2012 [18] has maintained the same limit.
Many authors in recent works have started to label
states with a half-life of several picoseconds also as isomers.
However, the general trend in the literature has
been to consider a half-life of 1 ns or greater as an isomer.
We note that there are at least 830 cases having
half-life between 1 to 10 ns; or about 1150 cases between
0.5 to 10 ns. In the current compilation, we have chosen
to keep the limit as 10 ns or greater.
Accordingly, the “Atlas of Nuclear Isomers” lists about
2469 isomers with a lower limit of half-life of 10 ns. The
number of odd-odd isomers is almost 804 which is nearly
double the number of even-even isomers which is almost

FIG. 1. Examples of different types of isomers.
417. There are 1248 isomers in the odd-A nuclei, almost
equal to the 1221 isomers in the even-A nuclei. We list
policies and explanation of the Table in section II, and
discuss the important features of the various types of isomers
in section III. All the compiled data are presented in
Table I. The data presented here include key properties of
the isomers, such as their excitation energies, half-lives,
spin-parities, decay modes, emitted gamma-ray energies
and their multipolarities.
Nuclear isomers generally decay to a lower energy state
via an electro-magnetic transition, which is also known
as the isomeric transition (IT). The isomers away from
the line of stability mostly decay via beta decay (β).
They may also decay via the beta delayed neutron decay
(β−n), beta delayed proton decay (β+p), alpha decay (α),
and spontaneous fission (SF). There are many new decay
modes recently discovered like the proton decay (p), double
proton decay (2p), electron capture delayed proton
decay (p), etc. We have included this information on
the decay modes.
It is interesting to identify and classify various regions
of the nuclear chart where isomers exist by considering
their properties and the reasons for hindrance. We have,
therefore, tried to systematize the isomers in terms of
their various properties in various charts and tables, presented
in section IV. These charts and graphs reveal many
systematic and novel features across the whole nuclear
landscape. Finally, section V summarizes the present
work.
II. POLICIES AND EXPLANATION OF THE
TABLE
We have used the experimental data from the ENSDF
database [16] as the main source for the present work.
However, data for many nuclides in the ENSDF database
remain out of date at any given time. Other databases
such as XUNDL (Experimental Unevaluated Nuclear
Data List) [19], NSR (Nuclear Science References) bibliographic
database [20], and Nubase-12 [18] have been
used for completeness. The isomeric data of Nubase-12

[18] have been individually cross-checked and used suitably
after consulting the original references. Further, the
recent literature from the primary nuclear physics journals
has been included with a cutoff date of August 15,
2015.
We have used some general policies in the compilation
procedures as listed below:
1. The lower limit on the half-life has been kept at 10
ns. The limit of 10 ns represents the central value,
not considering the upper or lower bounds of the
uncertainties. The isomers having half-lives with
the prefix LT, as listed in the ENSDF database,
have not been included.
2. The half-lives listed in the table are the values
taken from the ENSDF database, which may be
the weighted average values. In some cases, where
measurements have been reported but not included
in the ENSDF database, we have calculated the
weighted average values and listed the same in the
table. The half-lives measured for bare or, ionized
atoms have been flagged as @.
3. The unknown level energies, but expected to lie
near the ground state, have been listed as 0+X,
0+Y etc. The isomeric energy levels which are
expected to be at much higher energy above the
ground state have been quoted as X, Y etc.
4. The spin and parity within the parentheses are
tentative assignments based either on experiments
with indefinite results, systematic or theoretical
predictions.
5. The multipolarities within the parentheses are tentative
assignments taken mostly from the Adopted
datasets in the ENSDF database.
6. The references at the end are given in the form of
NSR database [20] key-numbers, in the same manner
as in the ENSDF database. We have tried to
give the original references for an isomer, but when
the number of references exceeds four, we quote the
NSR reference key-number of the published Nuclear
Data Sheets [20]. It may be noted that the references
do not necessarily refer to the discovery of
the isomer. Rather they mainly refer to the measured
half-life data and confirmation of spin-parity
assignment in case ENSDF is not confirming the
same.
7. The data for decay branches and gamma radiations
have been taken from the ENSDF database [16] unless
a later reference, not updated in the ENSDF,
has become available.

to the variation of pairing gap Δ = 12/

A.
8. The level energy, half-life, decay modes, and gammas
and multipolarities listed under parentheses
denote uncertain assignments.
9. The cases where the two lowest but unknown energy
levels are known, have been flagged as “†”, with a
note stating that “the ordering of the ground state
and the isomeric state is unknown”.
10. Some specific exceptions are:
• 67As: The 12-ns isomer from 2001JE10 has not
been confirmed by 2009OR02, and is not included.
• 93Rb: The 57(15)-μs isomer at 253.39(3) keV from
1970GR38 has not been confirmed by 2014MI12,
and is not included.
• 117La: The 10(5)-ms isomer from 2001SO02 has
not been seen by 2001MA69. 2011LI28 also does
not find any evidence for this isomer. This isomer,
therefore, is not included.
• Many new isomers, having half-lives in the μs
range, have been reported from experiments at
RIKEN in the period 2011-14. Most of this data
have not been published so far, and not included.
• Single-level nuclei: Many nuclei in which only single
level information is known, but not confirmed
as either the ground state or an isomer, are not included.
These nuclei are: 120La, 144I, 148Tm, 155Ta,
177Tm, 181Pb, 187Hf, 201Ra, 219Pa, 220Pa, 235Am,
246Bk and 246Es.
• Fission isomers: The fission isomers exist in the
path of fission, due to the trapping of the nucleus
into the second well at a superdeformed shape. A
table of fission isomers, due to Singh et al. [22],
lists 46 such isomers with no limit on the half-life.
Out of these 46 isomers, 32 isomers with half-lives
≥ 10 ns are included in our table. Besides these
32 cases, there may be about 10 more cases in our
table which are possible fission isomers, but not yet
classified as such.
• Mirror isomers: The isobaric pair of isomers, for
which the proton number of one isomer is equal
to the neutron number of the other isomer, and
vice-versa, is known as mirror isomers. We have

found seven such pairs. The pairs have identical
spin-parity and similar excitation energies. For example,
19F and 19Ne both have a 5/2+ isomer with
an excitation energy of about 200 keV.
• Self-conjugate isomers: The self-conjugate isomers
have N=Z, i.e. the neutron number equals the proton
number. For example, the 5+ isomer in 18F is
a self-conjugate isomer. There are 23 such cases,
of which 20 are odd-odd nuclei and 3 are even-even
nuclei.
• E0 isomers: There are 14 such cases, which arise
from the forbidden 0+ → 0+ transition in eveneven
nuclei. An example is the 0+ shape isomer in
72Kr.
Table I lists all the known isomers whose half-lives are
≥ 10 ns. The table has been organized into 10 columns.
The first three columns identify the nuclide in Z, N and
A numbers. The excitation energy, spin-parity, half-life,
gamma transition energies, multipolarities and the decay
modes of the isomer are listed from columns four to nine,
respectively. The last column lists the NSR key-number
of the references, while the actual citations are at the
end of the article. The flagged footnotes are given at the
bottom of each page.
III. TYPES OF ISOMERS
Isomers arise due to a hindrance in their decay. On
this basis, the nuclear isomers are generally classified into
four types, as shown in Fig. 1; the most common are the
spin isomers. The other types are the K-isomers, the
fission isomers and the shape isomers [12]. The fifth
category, now well known, is that of the seniority isomers.
They exist due to the role of seniority and the associated
symmetry of the pairing interaction in their decay.
A. Spin isomers
When an isomeric decay is hindered due to the difficulty
in meeting the spin selection rules, it gives rise to
a spin isomer. This generally involves a large change in
the angular momentum, giving rise to a transition of high
multipole character. An extreme example is the 180Ta isomer
having a spin of 9− with a half-life of > 1015 years. It

has only two low lying energy states, the 1+ ground and
2+ first excited states (Fig. 1). The lowest multipolarity
transition for decay will have a λ= 7, which makes the
decay very slow, and gives rise to the longest living and
the only naturally occurring known isomer so far.
B. K-isomers
The K-isomers are a kind of spin-trap structure whose
existence depends on the large change in K, the projection
of the total angular momentum on the symmetry
axis. For axially-symmetric deformed nuclei, K is a good
quantum number. When the change in the K-quantum
number, ΔK, becomes greater than the multipolarity λ of
the decay, the transition becomes hindered. Due to this
hindrance, the state becomes a K-isomer, whose degree
of forbiddenness is given by ν= ΔK − λ. For example,
180Hf has an isomer of spin 8 of the K= 8 band with a
half-life of 5.5 hours. The nearest level available for decay
is 8+ of the K= 0 band, where only λ= 1 transition is
needed. The change in K, i.e. ΔK= 8 is much larger than
the multipolarity λ = 1. This results in a high degree of
forbiddenness as ν= 7, and leads to a long half-life of the
isomer. Recent review of Kondev et al. [21] presents the
spectroscopic data of the K-isomers in deformed nuclei
with A > 100, and discusses their properties in terms of
the multi quasi-particle configurations.
C. Shape isomers
A secondary minimum supported at a shape quite distinct
from the ground state of the nucleus causes a nucleus
to be trapped in this minimum, which generally occurs
at a substantially large elongation as compared to the
ground state. The trapped nucleus, termed as a shape
isomer, can decay via gamma decay to the available low
energy states in the first minimum. For example, 72Kr, a
self conjugate nucleus, has a well known 0+ shape isomer
with a half-life of 26 ms, which exists due to the 0+ → 0+
shape hindered transition.
D. Fission isomers
The fission isomers are also shape isomers, but observed
in heavy nuclei in the trans-actinides. The sponta-

respectively.
neous fission decay mode becomes a distinct possibility in
this mass region. The nucleus trapped in the secondary
minimum at a superdeformed shape may decay via spontaneous
fission and/or decay back to the first minimum
by gamma decay. Depending primarily on the height of
the fission barrier, it may have a short or long half-life.
More than 45 isomers [22] have been observed to occur in
the path of fission and are known as the fission isomers.
The longest-lived example in this category is the 242Am
fission isomer, having a half-life of 14 ms.
E. Seniority isomers
The isomers, whose decay is hindered due to the difficulty
in the decay between the states of the same seniority,
are known as the seniority isomers. These isomers are
mainly found in the semi-magic nuclei, where the seniority
becomes a good quantum number due to the dominant
role of the intruder orbital in the respective valence space.
For example, the 10+ and the 27/2
−
isomers in the Z= 50
isotopic and the N= 82 isotonic chains behave as seniority
isomers after the mid-shell, having seniority v= 2 and 3
respectively [23, 24]. More recently, 6+ isomers have been
identified in the extremely neutron-rich Sn-isotopes lying
beyond N=82 magic number [25]. These isomers have
also been interpreted as seniority isomers, and constitute
an important set of data which sheds light on effective
interactions in neutron-rich systems [26].
IV. SYSTEMATICS OF ISOMERS
We have analyzed and systematized the data for isomers
in several ways. We present in this section the systematics
in the form of various graphs and charts and
also discuss the physics behind various features of these
isomers.
A. Excitation energy
We have plotted the excitation energies E(MeV) of the
isomers as a function of Z and N in a 3D diagram, Fig. 2.
The two projection planes represent the systematics of
the excitation energies for protons (right) and neutrons
(front), respectively. The solid lines in the 2D projections
correspond to the magic numbers. We note that

magic numbers, as expected. Besides the spherical
magic numbers, a group of isomers with high excitation
energies can be seen near Z≈ 70 and N≈ 100-110, where
high-K orbitals are known to occur.
We have further separated the isomers into three categories:
even-even, odd-odd, and odd-A isomers. The

even isomers are plotted with Z and N, in Fig. 3. The
solid curve represents the variation of pairing gap Δ=
12/(A). Vertical dashed lines mark the magic proton
and neutron numbers. We note that the odd-odd isomers
mostly lie below the pairing gap, being the twoquasiparticle
n-p excitations. The situation is just reversed
in the even-even nuclei where most of the isomers
lie above the pairing gap, which are also two- or higher
quasiparticle excitations formed after the breakup of a
pair of identical nucleons. There are seven E0 isomers
in the even-even nuclei between Z = 30 − 45, which lie
much below the pairing gap line in Fig. 3. All the seven
cases correspond to 0+ → 0+ transition in shape isomers
arising due to shape coexistence.

FIG. 11. Occurrence of the 13/2+ isomers throughout the nuclear landscape. The solid and the dashed lines depict the
approximate particle and hole occupancies for the respective orbital, shown in the figure.
The isomeric excitation energies of odd-A nuclei are
plotted with Z, N and A in the three panels of Fig. 4. Also
plotted are the excitation energies of all the isomers with
A in the forth panel. The solid line again corresponds to
the pairing gap parameter Δ, which is calculated by using
the relation 12/(A), where A is the mass number. We
find that the solid line passes through the gaps between
the one-quasiparticle isomers and the three-quasiparticle
isomers, which require the breakup of either a proton pair
or a neutron pair. However, there are isomers near the
magic numbers which fall within the gap also.
B. Half-life
We present the half-life systematic of nuclear isomers
on the (N, Z) plots for different half-life ranges in Fig. 5
and 6. Fig. 5 presents the data of isomers having halflives
in ns (nano-seconds), μs (micro-seconds), ms (milliseconds)
and s (seconds) range. Fig. 6 presents the same
in min (minutes), h (hours), d (days) and y (years) range.
The zig-zag line denotes the line of beta stability or, the
longest lived nuclides having a half-life of > 1010 seconds.
The beta stability line in the figure is discontinuous between
Z≈ 84-94, and N≈ 127-137, which is the region
of α-decaying radioactive nuclei. We find that the occurrence
of isomers also has a gap in the same region.
The largest number of isomers is obviously in the ns
range. Though the chart is only for nuclear isomers, but
it looks like a normal nuclear chart having some gaps visible
around Z= 80-90 with N= 130-140, Z= 100-110 with
N= 160-170, and Z= 70-80 with N= 85-105. Further, we
notice a distinct shift towards the neutron deficient side
in the occurrence of isomers from μs to min range. The
longest-lived isomers in the h to y range mostly lie on the
line of stability.
We have also plotted in Fig. 7, those isomers which
have a half-life longer than their respective ground state.
Their decay mode is also identified in the figure. There
are about 209 such isomers, of which 20 decay via 100%
IT mode with high multipolarity transition(s), while others
mostly decay via beta decay. Alpha-decay is also observed
for the heavier isomers.
We have already pointed out that the number of isomers
in odd-odd nuclei is almost double of that in eveneven
nuclei. This may be correlated with the absence, or
unusually large hindrance, of isomeric transitions in most
odd-odd nuclei as pointed out by Jain et al. [28]. This
may also be responsible for the observation that many
odd-odd isomers have a half-life longer than their respective
ground state. In particular, the absence of ΔI=3
transitions in a number of isomer pairs in many nuclei in
A=150-190 region remains a puzzle [28].
C. Spin
We have plotted the spin systematic for the negative
and the positive parity isomers in the two panels of Fig.
8. There are many features that are common to both
the parities. We note that there are peaks at half-integer
spins 1/2, 5/2, 7/2 and 9/2. We also note that the peak
at spin 1/2 is particularly high in both the positive and
the negative-parity isomers. Since spin 1/2 is the lowest

possible spin in odd-A nuclei, it is likely to give rise to an
isomer provided it lies low in energy as it is very likely
that the states lying below it have a spin higher than
1/2. Further, the occurrence of spin 1/2 is the highest
in the spectrum of any odd-A nucleus, particularly if it
is deformed as it occurs in each and every orbital. This
explains the peak at spin 1/2. Further, the spins 2, 3, and
4 mostly occur in even-even nuclei where the number of
isomers is the lowest. This results in the smaller peaks
at the intermediate spins of 5/2, 7/2, and 9/2.
Similarly, we notice peaks in the number of isomers at
integer spins 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 in both the positiveas
well as negative-parity spins, with occasional missing
peaks in either of the two parities. The integer high spin
isomers mostly arise in odd-odd nuclei and generally have
two quasi-particle configurations.
The peaks at 9/2+ and 13/2+ in the lower panel are
mostly due to the intruder and unique-parity g9/2 and
i13/2 orbitals in the respective valence spaces of odd-A,
odd-N isomers. Similarly, the highest peak, with more
than 160 isomers, is observed at the spin 11/2
−
, as shown
in the upper panel. This peak is due to the h11/2 orbital
in the odd-A, odd-Z isomers. We also notice small peaks
at 27/2 and 29/2, which are due to three quasi-particle
isomers.
We have plotted the occurrence of high-spin 9/2+,
11/2
−
and 13/2+ isomers in the nuclear chart shown in
Fig. 9, 10 and 11, respectively. These plots also show the
approximate locations of the particle and the hole fillings
in the g9/2, h11/2 and i13/2 orbitals, respectively. We notice
that most of the isomers neatly cluster around and
in between the particle and hole regions corresponding to
these orbitals.
We find that the 9/2+ isomers mostly lie around the Z
and N= 50 magic numbers; they are spread over the particle/
hole valence space of the intruder g9/2 orbital. We
also notice a group of isomers in the N= 82-126 valence
space having even Z. The excitation energies suggest that
the spin 9/2+ may arise from the 1-quasiparticle configuration
in the i13/2 orbital. The K= 9/2 projection of
i13/2 orbital may generate the 9/2+ isomers in this region,
which may be K-isomers. There are some isomers
just above the Z= 50 line, but having an even number of
neutrons. They lie in the middle of the N= 50-82 region
and may be deformed. The excitation energies for these
isomers lie around 0.5 MeV with K= 9/2 coming from
11

the g9/2 orbital. These may be examples of K-isomers.
The only 9/2+ isomer observed beyond Z= 82 is in 219Rn
which has a very low excitation of 4.47 keV. It decays via
an E2 transition, and originates from the 2g9/2 orbital.
We plot the distribution of the 11/2
−
isomers in
Fig. 10. The spin 11/2
−
isomers lying in a cluster
near A=100-208 region mostly originate from the uniqueparity
h11/2 orbital. Nearly all the isomers can be explained
as one-particle or one-hole excitations, whether
spherical or deformed on the basis of the low excitation
energies. There are five more cases, which lie near N=
153, far from this cluster region. All of them lie very
close to the ground state, only few hundred keV above.
This suggests that they also have a 1-quasiparticle structure,
which probably originates from the projection of the
j15/2 intruder orbital. Hence, these may be K-isomers, although
not characterized thus so far.
We plot the distribution of 13/2+ isomers in Fig. 11.
The 13/2+ spin has its origin in the i13/2 intruder orbital
in the N/Z= 82-126 valence space. The isomeric excitation
energies correspond to 1-quasiparticle configuration.
There is only one case of 13/2+ isomer in 69Cu, which has
a large excitation energy ∼ 2.7 MeV. We suggest that it
arises from a multi-quasiparticle configuration, although
mostly dominated by the intruder g9/2 orbital.
D. Multipolarity
Isomers are observed to decay by gamma transitions
having multipolarities from E1, M1 to M4 and E5. Decay
by lower multipolarity transitions is common and distributed
over all the mass regions. We have, therefore,
plotted in Fig. 12, the distribution of only those isomers,
which decay by transitions having higher multipolarities
like M2, E3, M3, E4, M4, and E5. Two remarks may be
made: one, there is a clustering of isomers in certain mass
regions for M2, E3 and M4 transitions; two, the number
of M4 decaying isomers is quite large whereas the number
of E4 and E5 decaying isomers is very small.
V. SUMMARY
We have collected the spectroscopic data for about
2469 isomers, with a lower limit on half-life at 10 ns. The
data have been presented in Table I. Various systematic
features of the isomers have been discussed in terms of
properties such as half-life, spin-parity, excitation energy,
and gamma-decay multipolarities. The literature cutoff
date of the data is August 15, 2015.

§: 2015NI05 quote the excitation energy of this isomer as 2261.1(4) keV relative to the energy of the 114 ms , 7 isomer.
#: ENSDF evaluators suggest that this level may be the ground state.
¤: The differences in half-lives may be due to different charge states of ions, and their subsequent effects on internal conversion.
*: Evidence for this isomer is still lacking since no decay data are available.
