         B.2 Residual Breakup Flags LR

         Many reactions are sequential in nature. That is, a particle or gamma ray may be emitted
         first, then the residual nucleus decays by one or more paths. Most often, the first stage of
         the reaction proceeds through a well-defined discrete state of the residual nucleus and the
         angular dependence of the first emitted particle must be uniquely described. A simple, two-
         body reaction is one in which the incident particle is inelastically scattered from the target
         nucleus leaving the target in an excited state, which immediately decays by gamma emission.
         Other excited states of the same target may, however, decay byparticle emission, electron-
         positron pair formation, or internal conversion. It is often necessary to completely specify
         the reaction mechanism, in particular for isotopic depletion and/or build-up calculations.
            The following numbers can be used as ﬂags to indicate the mode of decay of the residual
         nucleus.
