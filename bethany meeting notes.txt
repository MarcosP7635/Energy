bethany meeting notes 6/30/22

what is the optimal role/amount from a systems perspective? 
E.g. as a backup to solar, as a station that's supplementing lithium
ion batteries? 
How do the necessary feed materials compare the world's supply 
of each material? Next OOM calculation to do. 
Take into account the efficiency of the RTG as well. 

plot current methods and materials as well for comparison!
